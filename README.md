# README
This is a test. I could have deleted it after I was done. But I decided against
it, since I wanted to keep track of this. For future reference. And to remember
my humble beginnings.

What I've done:

* Make a local repo, then get it on GitHub.

* Make a "hello, world" example of an RMarkdown document, which we then knit to
html.

* Make a renderable R script from an existing RMarkdown document.

* Make a render ready R script from scratch.

I followed the excellent, no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point introduction on
[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com). I highly recommend it as a first
introduction to Git for R users.
